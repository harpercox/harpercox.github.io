The CLI Data Gem Project reminds you of all the things you thought you learned, that, in the meantime, you have actually forgotten.  

For those who find themselves just beginning the project, here are a few resources that I found invaluable:

1) The Learn IDE backs things up for me, so I have learned helplessness around Git.  For a simple refresher I liked ["Git - The Simple Guide"](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).

2) On creating gems, try the [railcast video](http://railscasts.com/episodes/245-new-gem-with-bundler?autoplay=true)  Avi recommends ([another one here](http://railscasts.com/episodes/201-bundler-revised)). I also liked ["First ruby Gem"](https://medium.com/@SunnyB/my-first-ruby-gem-part-2-a-look-under-the-hood-efe4a68ba42).  It was a bit beyond me, but helped me understand more of what was happening inside the bundler file structure.

3) I didn't know how to record my screen, so if you are mystified too, try this [imperfect but will-get-you-there video](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-screen-record-on-a-mac-and-ios-2017-12)  

4) Finally, when scraping gets you down, sign up for the google group "Nokogiri-talk."  They can help you out of any obscure scraping bind.  If you are thinking "I only vaguely remember scraping..." then here's [the original Learn scraping lab link](https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-development-v3/object-oriented-ruby/scraping/scraping-lab). 

Happy coding!
