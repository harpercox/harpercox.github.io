As a therapist (actually!) and someone who majored in comparative religions (for which my teenage son frequently mocks me) I get a lot of puzzled looks when I tell people that I am in the midst of a coding bootcamp.  After struggling to compose their faces, the follow-up question is always, "why do you want to do that?"  

Why do I want to do that?  Good question.  I'm not planning a big career change at the moment, and it's not like my life isn't already busy.  Why throw away my evening hours programming varieties of Tic Tac Toe? 

All I can tell you is that new learning curves are fun, I wonder if I have an app in me someday (something mental health related I think...), and I like puzzles.  People puzzles (why do we act how we act?), word puzzles (especially cryptoquip), and, it turns out, code puzzles.  It may not say much about my personality, but I get a big "hooray!" moment when I finally turn that ten lines of confusion into one clean line of code that does what I want it to do.  

The road of life, like a Git commit, has many branches.  We'll see where this one leads!
